# ðŸ’² Draft Banking Landing Page | Figma to Webpage

I got this cool banking landing page design from [Figma Community](https://www.figma.com/file/4iSgGqUHydWVAFeDYMArDv/Landing-Page-(Community)). A very unique and modern design. I converted this Figma design to a functional webpage using HTML, SCSS, Tailwind CSS and JavaScript. Functional Navbar, animated buttons and much more. This webpage is also mobile responsive
